# Web Programming Portfolio Activity 5
This is a TAFE assignment for the Diploma in Software Development, at the South Metropolitan TAFE,
Rockingham, Western Australia.

The project task is to write a PHP program that generates 100 integer
numbers between 1 and 10, and represents the occurrence of each number
(e.g. five 1s, four 2s, six 3s, etc....) with a bar chart.

The relevant files are:

- `index.php`
- `GetBarChart.php`
- `BarChart.php`

These files are in the `www` directory.

## BarChart
The file `BarChart.php` contains the class **BarChart**.  This class is used to collect the
information and settings required to build a bar chart, and provides the means to do so.
